This is simply a scratch repo to help me learn the use of Nix Flakes for Haskell development along with some extracurricular NixOS configuration fun. If you know your way around `git`, you can check out the commit, branch, and tag history to follow my follies from first commit to quit. Oh, snap.

> **Note**  
> Using `nix develop .` from within the repo allows me to open it with VS Code by calling `code .` for use within this flake-controlled development environment.

## upcoming test repos (perhaps)

- haskell project stack to nix conversion
- haskell project cabal to nix conversion
- haskell project stack to cabal conversion
- automated dev environments using direnv, nix-direnv, and lorri
